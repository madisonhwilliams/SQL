#1. Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive? (Hint: use HAVING).
#2. How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?
#3. What was the average amount spent per account in February? (Hint: For this question, we want the average amount spent / number of accounts, not the amount spent by each account).

#5. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?



#1. SELECT distinct location, count(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location like '%New York%'
GROUP BY location
HAVING count(orderID)>2;



#2. SELECT sum(quantity)as bquantity, Product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE product like '%Headphones%'
Group by product;

#3. SELECT avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id;

#4SELECT sum(quantity)/count(cust.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb

LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust 
ON cust.order_id=Feb.orderID;

#5. SELECT product, sum(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY sum(quantity*price) desc
LIMIT 10;
