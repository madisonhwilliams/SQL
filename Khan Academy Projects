Project 1. App Impersonator 
Think about your favorite apps, and pick one that stores your data- like a game that stores scores, an app that lets you post updates, etc.
Now in this project, you're going to imagine that the app stores your data in a SQL database (which is pretty likely!), and write SQL statements 
that might look like their own SQL.

CREATE a table to store the data.
INSERT a few example rows in the table.
Use an UPDATE to emulate what happens when you edit data in the app.
Use a DELETE to emulate what happens when you delete data in the app.


CREATE TABLE fetch (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, store TEXT, coupons INTEGER, savings INTEGER);

INSERT INTO fetch ( store, coupons, savings) VALUES ("dollar general", 20, 500);
SELECT * FROM fetch;
INSERT INTO fetch (store, coupons, savings) VALUES ("khols", 3, 134);
INSERT INTO fetch (store, coupons, savings) VALUES ("meijer", 16, 128);
SELECT * FROM fetch;
UPDATE fetch SET coupons= 25 WHERE id=1;
SELECT * FROM fetch;
DELETE FROM fetch WHERE id= 3;
SELECT * FROM fetch;


Project 2. Bike Store Database 
Create your own store! Your store should sell one type of things, like clothing or bikes, whatever you want your store to specialize in. 
You should have a table for all the items in your store, and at least 5 columns for the kind of data you think you'd need to store. 
You should sell at least 15 items, and use select statements to order your items by price and show at least one statistic about the items.


CREATE TABLE bikes (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, color TEXT, size INTEGER, price INTEGER, stock INTEGER);
INSERT INTO bikes VALUES(1, "schwinn", "blue", 20, 200, 5);
INSERT INTO bikes VALUES(2, "gubler", "black", 21, 179, 6);
INSERT INTO bikes VALUES(3, "matrix", "red", 18, 220, 2);

INSERT INTO bikes VALUES(14, "cherokee", "white", 18, 210, 3);
INSERT INTO bikes VALUES(15, "sierra", "gold", 22, 305, 5);

--display the database ordered by price 
SELECT * FROM bikes
ORDER BY price;

--What is the maximum price of any item?
SELECT name, MAX(price) FROM bikes;

What is the item with the most in stock?
SELECT name, MAX(stock) FROM bikes;


Project 3. Bobbies Hobbies 
#1. Insert one more row in persons and then one more row in hobbies that is related to the newly inserted person.
#2. Now, select the 2 tables with a join so that you can see each person's name next to their hobby
#3. Now, add an additional query that shows only the name and hobbies of 'Bobby McBobbyFace', using JOIN combined with WHERE.



CREATE TABLE persons (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT,
    age INTEGER);
    
INSERT INTO persons (name, age) VALUES ("Bobby McBobbyFace", 12);
INSERT INTO persons (name, age) VALUES ("Lucy BoBucie", 25);
INSERT INTO persons (name, age) VALUES ("Banana FoFanna", 14);
INSERT INTO persons (name, age) VALUES ("Shish Kabob", 20);
INSERT INTO persons (name, age) VALUES ("Fluffy Sparkles", 8);
INSERT INTO persons (name, age) VALUES ("John Doe", 35);

CREATE table hobbies (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    person_id INTEGER,
    name TEXT);
    
INSERT INTO hobbies (person_id, name) VALUES (1, "drawing");

Project 4. Book List
#1. Create a table with your favorite books with the title and your rating 

#1. CREATE TABLE books (id INTEGER, rating NUMERIC, name TEXT);

INSERT INTO books VALUES (1,"Harry Potter", 4);
INSERT INTO books VALUES (2, "physics", 5);
INSERT INTO books VALUES (3, "Colleen", 6);


Project 5. Box Office
#1. Select all of the movies

INSERT INTO movies VALUES (6, "Disney's Up", 2009);
 
 
#1. SELECT * FROM movies; 




Project 6. Clothing Alterations 
#1. Use ALTER to add a 'price' column to the table. Then select all the columns in each row to see what your table looks like now.
#2 Now assign each item a price, using UPDATE - item 1 should be 10 dollars, item 2 should be 20 dollars, item 3 should be 30 dollars. 
When you're done, do another SELECT of all the rows to check that it worked as expected.
#3. Now insert a new item into the table that has all three attributes filled in, including 'price'. 
Do one final SELECT of all the rows to check it worked.



CREATE TABLE clothes (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    type TEXT,
    design TEXT);
    
INSERT INTO clothes (type, design)
    VALUES ("dress", "pink polka dots");
INSERT INTO clothes (type, design)
    VALUES ("pants", "rainbow tie-dye");
INSERT INTO clothes (type, design)





Project 7. Customer Orders
#1. We've created a database for customers and their orders. Not all of the customers have made orders, however.
Come up with a query that lists the name and email of every customer followed by the item and price of orders they've made. 
Use a LEFT OUTER JOIN so that a customer is listed even if they've made no orders, and don't add any ORDER BY
#2. Now, create another query that will result in one row per each customer, with their name, email, and total amount of money 
they've spent on orders. Sort the rows according to the total money spent, from the most spent to the least spent

CREATE TABLE customers (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,

Project 8. Data Dig
#1. What are average, max, and min values in the data?
#2. What about those numbers per category in the data (using HAVING)?
#3. What ways are there to group the data values that don’t exist yet (using CASE)?
#4. What interesting ways are there to filter the data (using AND/OR)?
