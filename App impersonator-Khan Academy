Think about your favorite apps, and pick one that stores your data- like a game that stores scores, an app that lets you post updates, etc.
Now in this project, you're going to imagine that the app stores your data in a SQL database (which is pretty likely!), and write SQL statements 
that might look like their own SQL.

CREATE a table to store the data.
INSERT a few example rows in the table.
Use an UPDATE to emulate what happens when you edit data in the app.
Use a DELETE to emulate what happens when you delete data in the app.


CREATE TABLE fetch (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, store TEXT, coupons INTEGER, savings INTEGER);

INSERT INTO fetch ( store, coupons, savings) VALUES ("dollar general", 20, 500);
SELECT * FROM fetch;
INSERT INTO fetch (store, coupons, savings) VALUES ("khols", 3, 134);
INSERT INTO fetch (store, coupons, savings) VALUES ("meijer", 16, 128);
SELECT * FROM fetch;
UPDATE fetch SET coupons= 25 WHERE id=1;
SELECT * FROM fetch;
DELETE FROM fetch WHERE id= 3;
SELECT * FROM fetch;
