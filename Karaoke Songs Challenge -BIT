#1.  For the first step, select all the song titles.
#2.  Add another SELECT that uses OR to show the titles of the songs that have an 'epic' mood or a release date after 1990.
#3.  Add another SELECT that uses AND to show the titles of songs that are 'epic', and released after 1990, and less than 4 minutes long.


CREATE TABLE songs (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT,
    artist TEXT,
    mood TEXT,
    duration INTEGER,
    released INTEGER);
    
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released)
    VALUES ("Bohemian Rhapsody", "Queen", "epic", 60, 1975);
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released)
    VALUES ("Let it go", "Idina Menzel", "epic", 227, 2013);

    VALUES ("I will survive", "Gloria Gaynor", "epic", 198, 1978);

INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released)
    VALUES ("Call me maybe", "Carly Rae Jepsen", "happy", 193, 2011);
    
#1. SELECT "title" FROM songs;


/*AND*/
#2. SELECT "title" FROM songs WHERE released > 1990 OR mood ="epic";
/*AND*/
#3. SELECT "title" FROM songs WHERE released > 1990 AND mood="epic" AND duration < 240;

I used SQL to select song duration and mood from a database to narrow the information into groups
